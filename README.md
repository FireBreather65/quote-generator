## Inspiration
This project was originally created at a Vermont-based coding camp that I organized and attended. I have plans to improve upon this base in the future (scroll down to future plans for more details).

## Features
As the demo video shows, you can click "Get a quote!" and it will generate a random quote!

## Technologies
This website was built with HTML and Javascript on my end, with the API being provided by [Quotable.io](https://api.quotable.io/random).

## Challenges and accomplishments
I faced issues with understanding the FETCH function, but was able to solve them :)

## What I learned
I learned a lot about APIs for this project, and I'm so excited to dive deeper in the future.

## Future plans
This is a definite WIP. I want to be pivot the project's objective completely and use a different API. I'd also like to get more than one line of information from the API. Regarding the UI, I would love to add more (any) CSS.
